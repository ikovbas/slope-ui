Early development.

Current roadmap:
- UIkit fork: Port to Sass. Port customizer to Sass. Dist node-webkit customizers? Build custom default visual style and consider renaming UIkit classes. Decide if any classes are beyond the scope of this project and clean up as necessary.
- Angular-strap fork: Slim down configuration options. Decide on a set of UI conventions and remove functionality from angular-strap that doesn't fit these conventions. Identify bootstrap-dependent js and take note.
- Buttons, panels, modals
- Evaluate progress

·ç® Progress: Decision making. Roadmapping. Wrote readmes and licenses. Chores are done, time to develop some computer software. https://i.imgur.com/W6sm63k.gif
